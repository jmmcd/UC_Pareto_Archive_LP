Pareto Archive search.

* 16 June 2020:

Implemented IP and LP versions.
IP uses [LB, UB] int variables but I let it run for 5h30m, then killed it.
LP returns instantly. Continuous variables, ie no rounding and we define effective supply = demand.
Probably the best approach is a large grid search over LP weights.
generate_wts.py does this, but it would be nicer to do a pareto_lp inside here to avoid saving zillions of useless files. just pass 0 for every wt on command-line then grid-search inside here.

According to email from Svetlana, just ignore the solar
issue because of use of accumulators in the solar

* 15 Jan 2020:

Changed to [0, 1]
Fixed solar at max
Applied solar daylight factor
Saved Rounded and Relative supply
Avoid Seed 0 as CMA doesn't respect it
Use only one weight for env cost as it is similar to sus cost
Set peakedness weight to zero as it only applies to thermal and we are making those constant anyway
Fixed then re-fixed the number of return values from es.result, possibly result of CMA version mismatch
Upped sigma to 0.99 which seems ok, but 1.0 gives error.

* 2019:

Using CMA-ES, NSGA2, and other approaches to search for production schedules directly.
